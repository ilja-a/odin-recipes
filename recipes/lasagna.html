    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
      <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and sauté until the onion becomes translucent.</li>
      <li>Add the ground beef and Italian sausage to the skillet. Cook until browned, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon.</li>
      <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper. Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it cook for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
      <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese and half of the shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
      <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange a layer of cooked lasagna noodles on top.</li>
      <li>Spread half of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by another layer of meat sauce. Repeat the layers, ending with a layer of meat sauce on top.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle the remaining shredded mozzarella cheese and grated Parmesan cheese over the lasagna.</li>
      <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
      <li>Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing.</li>
      <li>Garnish with fresh basil leaves and serve hot.</li>
