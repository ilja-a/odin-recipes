  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons instant yeast</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups lukewarm water</li>

  <h2>Instructions:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, instant yeast, and salt. Mix well.</li>
    <li>Add the lukewarm water to the dry ingredients and stir until a sticky dough forms.</li>
    <li>Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let the dough rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until it doubles in size.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C). Place a Dutch oven or oven-safe pot with a lid inside the oven to preheat as well.</li>
    <li>Carefully remove the preheated pot from the oven. Transfer the risen dough into the pot, cover it with the lid, and bake for 30 minutes. Then, remove the lid and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes until the bread has a golden brown crust.</li>
